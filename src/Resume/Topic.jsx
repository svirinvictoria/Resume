          <p>Vice Chair - Department of Music</p>
            As vice-chair of the department, my responsibilities included seeing the big picture of
            the department at all times, lead the staff members and take care of the students’
            ongoing needs. I also organized the academic schedule, taking into account all staff
            members’ needs and restrictions. During my time with the department, we achieved the
            certificate of excellence 3 times.
            As part of my work, I was chosen to support a development team to build and apply a
            new Main Frame system for the whole organization. As a team member, I prepared
            characteristics of the new system, tested the first versions, liaised with key stakeholders
            and was responsible to support other users since the first release.
            Furthermore, I was responsible for the department’s documentation, working with ERP,
            MF, different academic and financial programs and systems.
            Additionally, I was responsible for the ongoing functioning of the office and its workers
            (total of 6 workers). I also took care of all financial issues in the department and
            sometimes with very challenging time schedules and tight organizational restrictions.
            Moreover, I was in charge of the department’s site, updating the content and checking
            for copyright issues.
